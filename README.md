# Thesis Manuscript
## Lo√Øc Masure - December, 18 2020 (oral defense)
This repository contains all the source files required to compile my thesis manuscript. I make it available online so that it may help any PhD student to start with a template. I started myself with a template from the Dorian Depriester's [blog post](https://blog.dorian-depriester.fr/latex/template-these/template-complet-pour-manuscrit-de-these), and transcripted it in english.

This work is also made available to the Side-Channel Analysis community to better seed my work, while waiting for my university to publish my manuscript.

## Compilation
````bash
pdflatex Main
bibtex Main
makeglossaries Main
pdflatex Main
pdflatex Main
````


## Writing chapter-wise
In the ``Main.tex`` file, one must add the following line to define the list of chapters to compile:
````latex
\includeonly{Chapitre1,Chapitre2,Annexes}
````

## Glossary
The glossary entries are defined in ``Glossary.tex``. To call one glossary entry, use the following line:

````
The [documentation](http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/glossaries/glossaries-user.pdf) of the ``glossaries`` Latex package may help.
