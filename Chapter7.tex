\chapter{Gradient Visualization for General Characterization in Profiling Attack}
\label{chap:gradient_viz}
This chapter is inspired from the poster presented at \textsc{Ches} 2018~\cite{masure_understanding_2018} and the paper published at \textsc{Cosade} 2019 in collaboration with Cécile Dumas and Emmanuel Prouff~\cite{masure_gradient_2019}.
This work has benefited from fruitful discussions with Élie Bursztein and Rémi Audebert.
